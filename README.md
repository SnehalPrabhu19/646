# MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM BASED ON CONTEXTUAL USER INFORMATION


In our research project, we propose to build a movie recommendation model that also considers some of the the contextual information about the user such as their dominant emotion and end
emotion while watching the movie, number of interactions with the
movie, as well as their geological location, weather at the location
when the movie was watched, mood, and time of day. We also use
the movie genres, directors, cast and time of release to supplement
the model. We believe that these factors affect the userâ€™s opinion
of a movie, and hence the ratings that the user will give it. We use
decision tree and random forest approaches to build our models.
We also perform evaluations to compare the quality of the results
obtained from our models with the metrics mean absolute error
and mean squared error.
